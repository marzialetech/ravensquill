# The Raven's Quill Bookstore

Website for The Raven's Quill Bookstore. Same mechanics as marziale.tech (no scroll, draggable icons, windows) with a dark academia aesthetic.

## Setup

1. **Contact form**: Get a free access key from [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com), then in `index.html`:
   - Replace `YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` with your key
   - Update the `mailTo` input `value` with the bookstore's email

2. **Deploy**: Push to a repo that serves `ravensquill.marziale.tech` (CNAME is set).
